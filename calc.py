# Huan's Comments:
# Thank you for teaching an old man what fairy comments are with your project!
# I had a good laugh with some of these.
# I think you demonstrate a solid understanding of how conditionals work.
# With more time, I would push you to consider using a dictionary to store statements
# and a function that returns the statment based on user input, which is an idea
# I think you were exploring from the code you commented out at the top. 😊

#     print("✨ im glad you came out of your comfort zone!" + genderDictionary[gender] + " 💞 🧚 Now go back there 🧚 🕳")
